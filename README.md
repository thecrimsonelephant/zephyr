This project, Zephyr, strives to be an end-to-end data pipeline and dashboard that blends air quality and weather data into executive-ready insights.  
Built with Python and free public APIs, it demonstrates the full ETL journey: ingestion â†’ transformation â†’ storage â†’ visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Problem: Air quality affects public health and insights often live in siloed datasets.  
- Solution: Zephyr ingests air quality and weather data, cleans and combines them, and delivers executive KPIs and interactive dashboards.  
- Goal: Showcase the ability to build end-to-end data pipelines in Python.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Ingestion: Python (`requests`, `pandas`)  
- Data Sources:  
  - [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/) â†’ air quality  
  - [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) â†’ weather  
- Storage: PostgreSQL
- Visualization: Streamlit Cloud
- Automation: GitHub Actions (daily pipeline runs)
